# Problem: Reverse Linked List

## Problem Statement

## Constraints
- The linked list can contain any number of nodes, including zero.
- The linked list nodes contain integer values.
- The implementation should handle edge cases such as an empty list or a single node.

## Instructions
- Use Java for implementation.
- Write clean and modular code.
- Add unit tests if applicable.
